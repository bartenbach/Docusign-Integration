# Node.js Launcher Code Examples

### Github repo: https://github.com/docusign/code-examples-node

This GitHub repo includes code examples for both the DocuSign eSignature REST API and the DocuSign Rooms API. 

To use the Rooms API code examples, modify the `exampleAPI` setting at the end of the config/appsettings.json file to `rooms`.

**Note:** To use the Rooms API, you must also [create your DocuSign developer account for Rooms](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/rooms101/create-account). 


## Introduction

This repo is a Node.js application that supports the following authentication workflows:

* Authentication with DocuSign via [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode).
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate. The refresh token is not used.

* Authentication with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

## eSignature API

## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note: If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 below as they're automatically performed for you.**

1. [Create a DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/) if you don't already have one.
1. A DocuSign integration key (client ID) that is configured for authentication to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).

   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and its secret key. 

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the **API Username** GUID of the impersonated user. See [Configure JWT](#configure-jwt) below for detailed steps.

   For both authentication flows:
   
   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include a redirect URI of http://localhost:5000/ds/callback

   If you will not be running the example on your own workstation, use the appropriate DNS name and port instead of localhost.

1. [Node.js version 8.10 or later with npm version 5 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. A name and email for a signer, and a name and email for a cc recipient.


### Installation steps
**Note: If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip step 4 below as it was automatically performed for you.**

1. Extract the [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) ZIP file or download or clone the [code-examples-node](https://github.com/docusign/code-examples-node) repository.

1. Switch to the folder: `cd <Quickstart_folder_name>` or `cd code-examples-node`

1. Run `npm install`

1. Create a new file config/appsettings.json by using config/appsettings.example.json as your template. Update config/appsettings.json with your integration key GUID and other settings.
   
   **Note:** Protect your integration key and secret and/or RSA private key pair; ensure that config/appsettings.json will not be stored in your source code repository.
   
1. `npm start`

1. Open a browser to http://localhost:5000


### Configure JWT
1. Create a new integration key on the [Apps and Keys](https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key) page and save the GUID to a secure location for step 5 below.
1. Set a redirect URI of http://localhost:5000/ds/callback
1. Generate an RSA key pair. Under **Apps and Integration Keys**, choose the integration key to use, then select **Actions**, then **Edit**. In the **Authentication** section, select **ADD RSA KEYPAIR**. Save the private key to a secure location for the next step.
1. Create a new file config/private.key, then save your RSA private key in it.
1. Update the file config/appsettings.json with your integration key GUID from step 1 as your `dsJWTClientId` and your **API Username** from the [Apps and Keys](https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key) page as your `impersonatedUserGuid`.
1. Run the launcher using `npm start`, then select **JSON Web Token** when authenticating your account.


## Payments code example
To use the payments example, create a test payments gateway for your DocuSign developer account. See [PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md](./PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md) for instructions.
   
Then add the **Gateway Account ID** to the config/appsettings.json file.


## Unit Testing

1. Before running the unit tests you will need to [obtain an access token](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/authcode-get-token/) and an **API Account ID**.
2. *Either:*
   * Update the file test/testHelpers.js in the project's root folder with the access token, **API Account ID**, signer and cc information, *or*
   * Create and export this information as the environment variables named in that file.
3. Run `npm test`
