<p>Data:</p>

<% if (event) { %>
  <p><b>event: <%= event %>.</b> This event parameter is supplied by DocuSign. 
    Since it could have been spoofed, don't make business decisions based on
    its value. Instead, query DocuSign as appropriate.</p>
<% } %>

<% if (envelopeId) { %>
  <p><b>envelopeId: <%= envelopeId %>.</b> The envelopeId parameter is supplied by DocuSign. 
    Since it could have been spoofed, don't make business decisions based on
    its value. Instead, query DocuSign as appropriate.</p>
<% } %>

<% if (state) { %>
  <p><b>state: <%= state %>.</b> This example state was sent to DocuSign and has now been received back.
     It is usually better to store state in your web framework's session.</p>
